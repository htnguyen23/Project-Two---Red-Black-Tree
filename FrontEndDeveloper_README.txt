Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Frontend.java - 
This file is the main driver and runner of the project. In this file are included various methods that deal with the searching,
adding, removing, editing, analyzing and other cases of superhero Character object. Most notable about this program is how is
branches from base mode into various modes like scoremode, namemode, and rostereditingmode, which then further branch into their
own commands and such of the methods. 

FrontEndDeveloperTests-
This file is the test file for frontend.java. It mainly analyzes different problem cases, such as making sure it instantiates
correctly, remvoing elements from empty arrays, searching for problematic data ranges and queries, etc. It tests a lot of the
cases I knew would give problems, however, it doesn't test ALL of them because there are so many, and the way JUnit deals with
analyzing strings as an output is very difficult.

CharacterDummy-
This was just a dummy class for my frontend to run properly. It's never actually used in the final implementation.

BackendDummy-
Same story as CharacterDummy. This one is also never actually used.

BackendInterfaceDummy-
Same story as BackendDummy. This one is also never actually used.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
I offered dealing with the roster on the frontend which could've been handled by either me or the backend.
